My research investigate knowledge representation and reasoning from a mathematical perspective, including:
1. **Neural graph database**: reasons complex logical queries over large, incomplete knowledge graphs.
2. **Prompt compression**: compresses inputted prompt of LLMs to facilitate long context inference.
3. **Knowledge editing**: modify parametric knowledge quickly and precisely in LLMs.
