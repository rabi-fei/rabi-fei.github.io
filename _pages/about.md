My research investigate knowledge representation and reasoning from a mathematical perspective, including:
1. **Neural graph database**: reasons complex logical queries over large, incomplete knowledge graphs.
2. **Prompt compression**: compresses inputted prompt of LLMs to facilitate long context inference.
3. **Knowledge editing**: modify parametric knowledge quickly and precisely in LLMs.

Preprints
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
